# GPIO Register : Specification 

In Task2 we did Normal GPIO with out own understanding. Now, the Specification is proper. 

In Task-3, you will upgrade your GPIO IP into a realistic peripheral with multiple registers that software can configure and control. 
Design a proper register map, implement direction control, and validate everything using a C program running on the RISC-V core. 

**Goal** : Task strengthens your understanding of memory-mapped I/O and prepares you for more advanced IPs used in real SoCs
